## Full Bio (2023)

Bethan Morgan-Williams (1992-) is a Welsh composer based in Montgomeryshire, having studied predominantly with Diderik Wagenaar at the Royal Conservatory in Den Haag; and with Gary Carpenter at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Bethan writes instrumental, vocal and electronic music for people of all ages and abilities, finding motivation through the simple urge to provide performers with new and exciting music. Described as “marvellously oblique and obscure” [5against4] while being “rooted in something ancient and folky” [The Telegraph], Bethan’s music is fluid and expressive.
In her short composing career, Bethan has already accrued a significant number of prestigious awards, including a Leverhulme Scholarship (2018-9); the Susan Bradshaw Composer Prize (RPS – 2017-8); the Christopher Brooks Composition Prize (Young Composer in Residence with the RLPO) (2015-7); and the LSO Panufnik Scheme (2015-6). She was shortlisted for ISCM World Music Days (2019 & 2020); a Paul Hamlyn Award (2017); and Manchester Jazz Festival’s Irwin Mitchell Prize (2014). Her music has already reached a wide audience through performances at venues/festivals including Hallé St. Michael’s and the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester; the Philharmonic Hall and St George’s Hall, Liverpool; Colston Hall, Bristol; Cheltenham Music Festival; Chapter Arts, Cardiff; LSO St. Luke’s and the British Museum, London; Norton Centre for the Arts, Kentucky; Haarlem Organ Festival and Korzo Theatre, The Netherlands; and Studio des Ensemble Musikfabrik, Cologne and Darmstadt Festival, Germany, with broadcasts on S4C, Radio 3, Hometown Radio (KY) and the Dutch radio society Omroep Max.
 
Bethan’s music has been commissioned and/or performed by internationally acclaimed ensembles including Psappha, Ensemble Musikfabrik, New European Ensemble, Ensemble 10/10, Uproar Ensemble, Ligeti Quartet, and the London Symphony Orchestra, as well as numerous established soloists, including Carl Rosman (clarinet), Ben Goldscheider (horn), Fenella Humphreys (violin) and Jennifer Johnston (mezzo soprano). Bethan considers chances to work closely with players a crucial part of her practice. Current preoccupations include the use of text as a means for generating rhythmic content; and the effects of revisiting material interactions on the substructure of ‘finished’ pieces.
Bethan is currently Tutor of Composition at Yorkshire Young Musicians (Leeds).
